# Overview

The Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL Cloud Wireless Controller (referred to as "controller" in this document) is a virtual wireless controller that is deployed on a Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) server as a virtual machine (VM) instance on a Linux-based 64-bit guest operating system. The supported private cloud providers are VMware ESXi, KVM, Hyper-V, and Cisco NFVIS (on ENCS).

The controller supports a subset of Cisco IOS XE software features and technologies, providing Cisco IOS XE features on a virtualization platform. When the controller is deployed as a VM, the Cisco IOS XE software functions as if it were deployed on a traditional Cisco hardware platform.
