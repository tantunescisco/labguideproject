## C - Knowledge of CX Labs rules and VLANs 

Depending on each CXLabs location, there are different ways to access lab devices, different VLANs and IP subnets.
Verify with your lab proctor/trainer what are the CXLabs rules you should be aware of and the VLANs and subnets on your location for wireless recreates.
For example, in EMEA BRU this is the Engineer Information: [BRU Wireless Recreates]{:target="_blank"}
